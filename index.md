excerpt: geOrchestra is a free, modular, interoperable & secure Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)
---

geOrchestra is a **free**, **modular** and **interoperable** [Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Data_Infrastructure) software born in 2009 to meet the requirements of the [INSPIRE](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_for_Spatial_Information_in_the_European_Community) directive in Europe.

geOrchestra's core features a security proxy and a [single-sign-on authentication system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).
Next to this core are independant and interoperable modules to build your own Spatial Data Infrastructure:

 * a metadata catalog based on [GeoNetwork](http://geonetwork-opensource.org/),
 * a map and features server: [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/),
 * a map tile server: [GeoWebCache](http://geowebcache.org/),
 * an advanced web map viewer,
 * a data extractor,
 * and several other admin-oriented modules.

Modules interact using [OGC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium) interfaces or [REST APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).

Initially covering Brittany, then France, geOrchestra now spreads worldwide with SDIs in Bolivia, Nicaragua, Germany and India.
