The geOrchestra team is happy to bring you some updates about the geOcom 2024.

This 11<sup>th</sup> edition will take place on the **17<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> of  June 2024** at Lille, France, in the Lille European Metropole headquarters.
In the continuity of our last codesprint, it will be followed by a 2-days code/doc sprint on the **20<sup>st</sup> and 21<sup>nd</sup> of June 2024**, hosted in the same place.
You are all welcome to participate !


The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases. This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality.
