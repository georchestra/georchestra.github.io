Checkout our brand new geOrchestra website !

Based on free software ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), it features a **mobile-friendly** blog and static pages at the same place, with **full multilingual content** (English, French & Spanish).

<!--more-->

For those who are interested, or who'd like to contribute, the source code can be found in the [georchestra/georchestra.github.io](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra.github.io) repository.
Using github for the blog means we can take advantage of the dedicated tools, such as this wonderful [Kanban board](https://huboard.com/georchestra/georchestra.github.io), kept in sync with GitHub issues.<br />
Finally, submitting a new blog post is now open to everyone: it's just a pull-request !

But let's come back to Jekyll, our site-generation engine. Customizing it is easy...<br />
In particular, it offers powerful support for code snippets, eg here in ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

To finish with, we'd like to thank GitHub for their awesome hosting !
