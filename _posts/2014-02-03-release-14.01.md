<div class="post-excerpt">

<p>The geOrchestra community are pleased to announce the immediate release of
version 14.01. Since the June 2013 release 151 evolutions took place,
emphasising on stability, analysis, and data sharing.</p>

</div>

<div class="post-content">

<p>This release was once again achieved by the community of users. They are
spotted on the <a href="http://sdi.georchestra.org/" hreflang="en">demo
site</a>, which opens on a global <a href="http://sdi.georchestra.org/mapfishapp/?lang=en" hreflang="en">map of the
geOrchestra community members</a>. How about paying them a visit?!</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/georchestra" hreflang="en"><img src="/public/screenshots/14.01/ohloh.png" alt="ohloh" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" title="ohloh, Feb. 2014" /></a> geOrchestra
14.01 includes the following new features amongst the <a href="https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues?milestone=3&amp;state=closed" hreflang="en">35 improvements and 116 issues addressed</a> processed. As shown
by <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/georchestra" hreflang="en">Ohloh</a> the
project has seen a sustained activity since the last release.</p>
<h3>Multilayer querying</h3>
<p>A multilayer querying mode was added to the main toolbar. This mode enables
map querying and returns the outcomes as a table for each layer displayed.
Simple and multicriteria queries remain available through the layers' dedicated
menus.</p>

<h3>Extractor addon</h3>
<p>Makes direct download of all the data currently displayed possible without
moving to the extractor's user interface. The user state their coordinate
system, output format, raster resolution where applicable, email address to
send the data to, and geographical extent. Separate download for each dataset
remains an option with the layer's &quot;action&quot; menu. As a reminder the extractor
module is designed to organise and download the data from the geOrchestra SDI
or third party services on-demand.</p>
<p>This functionality is an optional addon users need to activate in their
profile prior to using it.</p>

<h3>Persistence of OGC documents</h3>
<p>Users' compositions: Web Map Context (map composition) and Styled Layer
Descriptor (data symbolisation) are stored in a database. Each document has its
unique URL, visit counter, and reference to its creator.</p>
<h3>Menu &quot;Share&quot;</h3>
<p>A new &quot;Share this map&quot; action illustrates the pertinence of OGC documents'
persistence:</p>
<p>A map may be</p>
<ul>
<li>kept as a <a href="http://sdi.georchestra.org/mapfishapp/map/0d05bc8b10db4c292639db9e6d713641?lang=en" hreflang="en">permalink</a></li>
<li>modified by a third party as to compose a <a href="http://sdi.georchestra.org/mapfishapp/map/0c3641dfaade3b5c366f78eac125fd7e?lang=en" hreflang="en">new map with a bespoke SLD analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sdi.georchestra.org/sviewer/?wmc=468401c3b96667adfe2af8d261b82b01" hreflang="en">sent to alternative viewers</a></li>
<li>sent to third party applications or shared on social networks the admins
select in the viewer's settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus from a single map one can design as many consumption modes as they
wish: from a basic viewer to the specialist's application.</p>
<p><img src="/public/screenshots/14.01/share.png" alt="share or send map" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="share or send map, Feb. 2014" /></p>
<h3>Lightweight viewer</h3>
<p>A lightweight viewer powered by Openlayers3 and jQuery mobile was tuned for
the occasion. It interacts with the &quot;Share map&quot; action to forward a map context
on a mobile phone or tablet PC. The lightweight viewer queries the capabilities
to join a map its legend, titles and data description, product credits, and
keeps a link to metadata. One can still switch back to geOrchestra's default
viewer for a change in map composition and thematic data analysis. The
lightweight viewer is available in English, French, Spanish, and Russian.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Data editor</h3>
<p>GeoServer is one of the few OGC service providers offering a fairly complete
data service (WFS 2.0). Every vector data delivered by GeoServer is remotely
editable to whom is granted permission. This capability was previously
exploited through QGIS or a dedicated geOrchestra application.The use of two
applications to view and edit data made the editing process complicated.</p>
<p>The viewer in geOrchestra now includes distant editing for all vector data.
Whence a piece of data is toggled to editing objects are selected on-the-fly.
One click makes the editing form active. Geometry and attributes may then be
modified. Each modification is immediately propagated onto the map with its
current style.</p>

<h3>Layer order</h3>
<p>The viewer accounts for opacity as stated by WMS services. Layers deemed
<em>'opaque</em>' (i.e. <em>covering</em>) are placed in the background with a
progressive zoom adapted to basemaps. Attributary data are displayed foreground
without a zoom effect.</p>
<h3>OpenLS location</h3>
<p>In addition to GeoNames location (via geonames.org which now requires a
registration) and Referential (on existing WFS layers) previously available a
new addon now provides search through the OpenLS service (for compatibility
with other SDIs as France's IGN GeoPortail). We are now looking for freely
available worldwide OpenLS services to power the default geOrchestra
configuration.</p>
<p><img src="/public/screenshots/14.01/openls.png" alt="openls" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="openls, Feb. 2014" /></p>
<h3>Managing permissions</h3>
<p>GeoFence is an advanced permission manager for GeoServer. GeoFences makes
the fine-tuning of data access and permission possible by setting
layer-specific geographical and attributal criteria as well as by user or
group.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>ArcGIS clients are detected and are attributed a specific authentication
filter to grant access to protected data</p>
<p>The embedded GeoWebCache tile engine does security checks on the underlying
GeoServer WMS providers. WMS-C, TMS and WMTS layers are now protected though
GeoServer or GeoFence permissions.</p>
<h3>Notice to admins</h3>
<p>Prior to upgrading, please read <a href="https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md" hreflang="en">release notes</a>. Please note the geOrchestra databases were
reorganised: every module now store their data in a single PostgreSQL base
segmented into schemas. However the admins keep the option to spread the data
over several bases.</p>
<h2>On the community's side</h2>

</ul>
<h3>geOcom 2014</h3>
<p>Following the success of the 2013 edition, we hope to share with you all
these novelties and together discuss the forthcoming ones at geOcom 2014, which
is expected to be organised in May or June.</p>
<h3>Special notice</h3>
<p>Finally we would like to thank team <a href="http://geowww.agrocampus-ouest.fr/web/" hreflang="en">géoSAS</a> from
INRA+agrocampus Ouest for their enduring participation in the geOrchestra
community. This research team <a href="http://geowww.agrocampus-ouest.fr/web/?p=1120" hreflang="en">was awarded</a>
in October 2013, the second prize of visualisation in geomatics at the
International Festival of Geography, Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, France, for <a href="http://geowww.agrocampus-ouest.fr/web/?p=1164" hreflang="en">addon
Watershed</a> (a dynamic catchment delineation using OGC Web Processing
Service) powered by geOrchestra.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev.geobretagne.fr/mapfishapp/map/9bbd5008dacd20e8662b0344ac161457" hreflang="en"><img src="/public/screenshots/14.01/bv.png" alt="Addon watershed from GeoBretagne" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="Addon watershed from GeoBretagne, Feb. 2014" /> example: 109 watersheds
processed from an outlet layer</a></p>
<p>The addon and its service are in production, SDI GéoBretagne uses it on a
daily basis (<a href="http://geobretagne.fr/mapfishapp/?lang=en" hreflang="en">viewer &gt; tools&gt; manage tools</a>). This contribution from the GéoSAS
team completely relies on the philosophy an architecture choices which keep the
community moving forward and make geOrchestra a free, open, interoperable, and
cutting-edge SDI.</p>
