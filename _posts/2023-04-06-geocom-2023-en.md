The geOrchestra team is happy to bring you some updates about the geOcom 2023.

This 10<sup>th</sup> edition will take place on the **30<sup>th</sup> and 31<sup>th</sup> of May 2023** at Saint-Mandé, France, in the CRESCO, located just beside the French National Geographical Institute, IGN.
In the continuity of our last codesprint in Rennes, it will be followed by a 2-days code/doc sprint on the **1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> of June 2023**, hosted by the IGN in their Georoom. You are all welcome to participate !


The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases. This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality.
