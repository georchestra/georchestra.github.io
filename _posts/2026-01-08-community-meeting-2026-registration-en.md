Twice a year, in the spirit of the project's manifest, developers and platform administrators gather to collaborate on the evolution of geOrchestra.

The next geOrchestra community meeting will be held in Ariège, France, from March 30 to April 3, 2026.

<!--more-->

March 30 and April 3 will likely be days of travel and settling in unless many of you arrive earlier (or leave later)!

As with the [2024 edition](https://www.georchestra.org/blog/2024/04/04/community-sprint-ariege-fr/), we will be hosted with full board in a peaceful setting at the [Vallon d'Aïga](https://www.vallon-aiga.com/accueil). We will work there on technical aspects as well as governance and documentation topics.

Whatever your background, if geOrchestra is part of your ecosystem, you'll find your place.

If you're simply curious but don't yet use geOrchestra, you'll probably prefer to wait for geOcom 2026. That being said, we're also planning to organize a welcome and project discovery session during this winter meeting: if you're interested, contact us at psc@georchestra.org.

## Accommodation

We will be staying with full board at Vallon d'Aïga, 2 Chemin du Col d'Ussat, 09400 Ornolac-Ussat-les-Bains, France.

## Participation charges

_**This is a free event.**_ 

The only expected charges will be your accommodation and meal costs, payable directly to the host organization (Vallon d'Aïga). They offer various options for accommodation (shared rooms with 2 or 3 beds, single rooms with a supplement of €15/night, dormitories if you want to save money, and the most adventurous can even pitch a tent).  
[More details](/public/communitymeeting2026/Aiga-conditions-tarifaires.pdf).

You can also manage your own accomodation of course.
