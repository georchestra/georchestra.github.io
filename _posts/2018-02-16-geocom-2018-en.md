The geOcom 2018 event will be hosted this year by the "Hauts-de-France" region, in France, on **June 12th to 13th**. Let's meet in **Amiens** to share ideas, discuss upcoming changes or discover geOrchestra and its community !

<!--more-->

The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases.

This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality and discovery of the region.
The geOcom will be followed by two days of code and doc sprint, which allows to give a helping hand on top priority topics.
