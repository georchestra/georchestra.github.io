The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases. This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality.


We therefore invite you now to:

  * reserve these dates in your diaries
  * **book your accommodation very quickly**
  * tell us your expectations regarding exchanges
  * **propose an intervention** if you wish
