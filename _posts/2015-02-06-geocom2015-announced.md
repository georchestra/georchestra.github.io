## With the community at its centre

geOrchestra as a project was decidedly built a community from its very start. To us this means that users, contributers, funders, developers, teachers, and researchers, all have their say in order to set the project's roadmap.

Project [GeoBolivia](https://geo.gob.bo/) who invited the PSC in 2012 made us aware of the interest of gathering the community, as the aims of ours SDIs are different and complementary at the same time.

Then followed the first GeoCom (2013) in Rennes, France, hosted by [Agrocampus Ouest](https://geowww.agrocampus-ouest.fr/). Exposing together state, regional, council, and research, SDIs genuinely fuelled our reflections, from which stemmed the implementation of professional add-ons and a dedication to share different tools for different audiences.

In 2014, [CRAIG brought us together](#) in Clermont Ferrand, France. There we found a diversified community with a will to stress on the support to managers. This resulted in a documentation work and an effort to make the installation process simpler.

## Heading to Alsace

We happily announce the same dynamic for 2015. The [CIGAL](https://www.cigalsace.org/) (Cooperation Geographic Information in Alsace) partnership have agreed (many thanks to them!) to host GeoCom 2015 in Strasbourg, France. The proposed dates are 22-24 june. The event is obviously free and everyone interested in geOrchestra are warmly invited.
