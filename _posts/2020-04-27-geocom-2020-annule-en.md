PSC members regret to announce that they have decided to cancel the geOcom 2020 which was to be held in Perros-Guirec in June.

We postpone this decision as late as possible because we did not have, until last week, all the information allowing us to arbitrate in one way or another.
It now appears obvious that even if we had maintained the event it is not certain that you could have moved.
We have not retained the option of carrying out a geOcom by videoconference or webinar.

On the other hand, we suggest to schedule an intermediate geOcom in autumn or winter 2020.
