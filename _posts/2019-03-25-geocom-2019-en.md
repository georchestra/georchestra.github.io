City and agglomeration community of Le Puy-en-Velay will host the 2019 geOcom by **17 18 and 19 of june 2019.**

The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases. This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality and discovery of the region.

The geOcom will be followed by two days of code and/or doc sprint, which allows to give a helping hand on top priority topics.
