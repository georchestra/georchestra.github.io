geOrchestra 14.06 is out !  
This is essentially a maintenance version with some nice improvements.

<!--more-->

Front office:

 * a new GeoWebCache module, useful to deploy independant tile caches; this gives more speed and availablility to high traffic layers,
 * a complete german translation (thanks CIGALsace).

Hidden, but no less important:

 * better roles separation, for administration (datas / metadatas / user managemnent) and for accessing modules (extractor / statistics).
 * Single Sign On upgraded to JASIG CAS 4.0.0 final version,
 * the whole software suite works under https, delivers secure data services (Rennes MÃ©tropole contribution),
 * configuration is now easier, since build parameters are in one place, and only one database is mandatory. You still can customize anything you want for your install,
 * better unit tests coverage on many modules (ldapadmin, mapfishapp, extractorapp, downloadform),
 * GDAL/OGR natives libraries are handled more appropriately,
 * GeoFence performs better.

On the documentation side : the documentation closely sticks to the source code, you can reach it directly from the [README](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/) file, located in the project's root directory.

During geOcom 2014, Vienne agglomeration announced that they wrote and published a multi-tomcat install documentation [[source](https://github.com/viennagglo/georchestra-doc)] under a [Open Licence](https://github.com/viennagglo/georchestra-doc/blob/master/licence.md). Thanks a lot for their commitment in the project !

You want to install, update your geOrchestra instance or get more information about this new version, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/).
