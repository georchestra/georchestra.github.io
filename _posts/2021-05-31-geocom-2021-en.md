After the cancellation of geOcom 2020 due to the SARS-COV 2 / COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, the geOrchestra steering committee is offering you a remote geOcom 2021. Hoping very much for a 2022, face-to-face edition ...

The geOcom 2021 will take place over 3 half days on Tuesday 8, Wednesday 9 and Thursday 10 June, from 2 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.

The geOrchestra community gathers every year at the "geOcom" event. This is a unique opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the upcoming releases. This event allows actors and newcomers to discover the community and its uses, issues in progress or to come.
