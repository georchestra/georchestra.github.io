The 2025 edition of **geOcom** brought together over 100 participants for three days in Rennes: users, developers, local authorities, design offices, researchers, public officials, and more. All gathered around **geOrchestra**, the open-source, modular, and interoperable platform dedicated to the management and dissemination of territorial data. Thank you all for your presence, your feedback, your contributions, and your ideas!

## ü§ù A friendly and unifying gathering

geOcom 2025 wasn't just a packed program: it was also a warm and collaborative atmosphere, conducive to informal exchanges and the emergence of new collaborations. Some highlights:

* A wide variety of profiles, including geomaticians, developers, IT managers, field agents, and data scientists, in a variety of fields: planning, environment, research, cooperation, and health,
* A good geographical representation: Brittany, Grand Est, Hauts-de-France, Aura, √éle-de-France, Overseas Territories, and also feedback from Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
* More than 20 new people participating in their first geOcom‚Äîproof of an open and growing community.
